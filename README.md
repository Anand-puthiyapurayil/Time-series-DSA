UNIVARIATE SUNSPOT DATA

This dataset describes a monthly count of the number of observed sunspots for just over 230 years (1749-1983).
The units are a count and there are 2,820 observations. 
246 points of anomaly is detected, and it is due to extreme counts in the sunspots.



MULTIVARIATE WIND SPEED

The dataset contains 6574 instances of daily averaged responses from an array of 5 weather variables sensors embedded in a meteorological station. 
Data were recorded from January 1961 to December 1978 (17 years). Ground Truth daily averaged precipitations, maximum and minimum temperatures, and grass minimum temperature were provided.

Anomaly is detected as 580 data sets due to the high wind speed or high precipitation/rain, temperature variations.
